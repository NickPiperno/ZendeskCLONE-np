# Backend Workflow

## Project State
Project Phase: Phase 6 - Customer-Facing Features
Backend-Focused

## Task Management
- [x] Identify current backend tasks from docs/living/checklists or relevant phase file
- [x] Copy task details to "Primary Feature" section
- [x] Break down into "Component Features" if needed

---

## Primary Feature
Name: Customer Portal Foundation
Description: Setting up secure customer ticket endpoints and Knowledge Base infrastructure

### Component Features
- [x] Secure Customer Ticket Endpoints
  - [x] Design RLS policies for customer ticket access
  - [x] Create customer-specific views
  - [x] Implement ticket query endpoints
  - [x] Add data validation and security checks

- [x] Knowledge Base Infrastructure
  - [x] Create Knowledge Base table schema
  - [x] Set up full-text search configuration
  - [x] Implement search query optimization
  - [x] Add article categorization system

Next Steps:
1. Create TypeScript types for new database schema
2. Implement Supabase client queries for KB search
3. Set up API endpoints for customer ticket timeline
4. Add integration tests for new endpoints

## Progress Checklist

### Understanding Phase
- [x] Documentation Review
    - [x] Tech stack guidelines (`tech-stack.md`, `tech-stack-rules.md`)
    - [x] Existing services and utils (`services.ts`, `database.ts`, `feature/*/utils`)
    - [x] Data models (`lib/types`)
    - [x] Integration points (endpoints, auth boundaries)
    - [x] Real-time features (presence, typing, notifications)
- Notes: Completed foundation layer with KB and customer ticket access

### Planning Phase
- [x] Architecture
    - [x] Data flow and relationships
    - [x] API/route handler structure
    - [x] Type definitions and Zod schemas
    - [x] Real-time requirements
    - [x] Test specifications (per `test-rules.md`)
    - [x] PAUSE, Check in with user
- Notes: Foundation layer complete, ready for TypeScript integration

### Implementation Phase
