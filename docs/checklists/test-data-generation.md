- [ ] Validate context window creation
- [ ] Test response generation with retrieved context

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Measure query response times
- [ ] Test with different batch sizes

- [ ] Monitor API usage and costs

## Documentation
- [ ] Document test data structure
- [ ] Document query patterns and best practices
- [ ] Create example queries for common use cases
- [ ] Document performance benchmarks

## Notes
- Basic query testing completed with good results across all document types
- Document type filtering working correctly with metadata
- Semantic search showing good relevance for related concepts
- Some team-specific queries could be improved with more detailed team descriptions
