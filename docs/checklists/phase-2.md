# Phase 2: Ticket Data Model & API First Steps

This phase focuses on establishing the "living document" concept for tickets (per @project-overview.md) and starting the API layer described in @user-flow.md and @tech-stack-rules.md.

---

## Flattened Task List

[ ] FRONTEND: Create TypeScript interfaces for Ticket (ticketTypes.ts) reflecting @project-overview.md.  
[ ] FRONTEND: Build a minimal "TicketList" component to fetch/display tickets from the backend.  
[ ] FRONTEND: Create a "New Ticket" component or modal to capture title, description, priority, etc.  
[ ] BACKEND: Create PostgreSQL table(s) for tickets (id, createdAt, updatedAt, status, priority, tags, custom fields).  
[ ] BACKEND: Enable row-level security policies to restrict ticket access to authorized users.  
[ ] BACKEND: Implement basic ticket endpoints (POST /tickets, GET /tickets, GET /tickets/:id, PATCH /tickets/:id).  
[ ] BACKEND: Add minimal error handling and logs (e.g., console or external logging).
