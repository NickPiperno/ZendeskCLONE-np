# AutoCRM AI Feature Documentation

This document describes the new AI functionality being integrated into AutoCRM. The goal is to automate CRM data updates and retrieval through natural-language user input, minimizing manual efforts and improving overall efficiency.

## 1. Feature Scope & Objectives

1. **Conversational Assistance**  
   - Accepts natural language text input
   - Uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to fetch and analyze CRM data context
   - Identifies and extracts entities such as customer names, order numbers, dates, etc.

2. **AI-Powered Object & Field Mapping**  
   - Determines which internal entity or table needs updating (e.g., "Customer Profile," "Sales Order," "Support Ticket")
   - Identifies the relevant fields to update (e.g., "contact name," "order status," "incident date")

3. **Cross-Domain Operations**
   - Integrates knowledge base with ticket management
   - Matches team skills with ticket requirements
   - Enriches knowledge base from ticket resolutions

4. **Guided Confirmation & Reversibility**  
   - Prompts the user to confirm each proposed database action
   - Offers an "undo" feature for immediate reversal of recent changes
   - Provides clear error recovery options

## 2. System Architecture & Integration

### 2.1 Frontend (Vite + React + Tailwind/Shadcn UI)

• A floating, chat-like interface within the AutoCRM app allows the user to input commands
• The chat UI:  
  - Displays AI-generated responses, user queries, and step-by-step update confirmations
  - Integrates with Shadcn UI components for an accessible and cohesive design
  - Shows context-aware suggestions and operation progress
• State Management: Redux or the Context API tracks conversation state and user confirmations

### 2.2 Backend (Node.js + Supabase + AI Orchestration)

• **Agent Pipeline**:
  1. **Input Processing**: Convert natural language into structured input
  2. **RAG Agent**: Use Supabase vector storage to find relevant context
  3. **Entity Recognition Agent**: Identify entities and their types
  4. **Task Router Agent**: Route to appropriate domain agent
  5. **Domain Agents**: Handle domain-specific operations (KB, Ticket, Team)
  6. **Execution Agent**: 
     - Validate operations and permissions
     - Perform database updates via Supabase's REST/GraphQL endpoints
     - Handle transaction management and rollbacks
     - Request explicit user approval before changes
  7. **Audit Agent**: 
     - Log operations and changes
     - Store previous states for undo operations
     - Track operation history
  8. **Response Agent**: Generate context-aware responses

### 2.3 Security & Audit

• **Role-Based Access Control**: Ensures only authorized agents can confirm certain updates
• **Row-Level Security**: Enforces constraints at the database level
• **Audit Trail**: 
  - Comprehensive logging of all AI-driven changes
  - Store previous states for rollback operations
  - Track operation sequences for multi-step rollbacks
• **Circuit Breakers**: Prevent system overload and handle failures gracefully

## 3. Technical Considerations

1. **Context Management**  
   - Preserve conversation context across multiple interactions
   - Store operation state for multi-step processes
   - Handle partial completions and rollbacks

2. **Cross-Domain Operations**  
   - Manage state across multiple domains
   - Handle compensation operations for rollbacks
   - Preserve audit trails during complex operations

3. **Testing**  
   - Comprehensive test coverage for all agents
   - Cross-domain operation testing
   - Error recovery scenarios
   - Performance benchmarks

4. **Monitoring & Analytics**  
   - Agent performance metrics
   - Operation success rates
   - System health monitoring
   - Resource utilization tracking

## 4. Usage Workflow

1. **User Input**  
   - The user types a command, such as "Change Mark Johnson's phone number to 555-1234"
2. **Processing Pipeline**  
   - Input processing and RAG retrieval
   - Entity recognition identifies relevant data
   - Task routing to appropriate domain
   - Validation and execution
3. **Confirmation & Execution**  
   - System shows preview of changes
   - User confirms or modifies
   - Execution with proper validation
4. **Audit & Response**  
   - Changes are logged
   - Context-aware response generated
   - Error recovery options if needed

## 5. Implementation Steps

1. **Core Agent Implementation**  
   - Input processing and RAG
   - Entity recognition
   - Task routing
   - Domain-specific agents

2. **Execution & Response Layer**  
   - Validation integration
   - Operation execution
   - Audit logging
   - Response generation

3. **Cross-Domain Operations**  
   - KB-Ticket integration
   - Team-Ticket integration
   - Knowledge base enrichment

4. **Advanced Features**  
   - Multi-step operations
   - Complex rollbacks
   - Performance monitoring
   - System analytics
