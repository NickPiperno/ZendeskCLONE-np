# User Flow

This document outlines how users (customers, employees, and administrators) interact with the various components of AutoCRM. It details the typical journey from authentication through ticket creation, management, and resolution.

## 1. Authentication & Entry Points

1. **Customer Login**
   - Users sign in via a secure portal or through embedded widgets in partner applications.
   - After login, customers can access their **Ticket Dashboard**, **Knowledge Base**, and **Self-Service Tools**.

2. **Employee & Admin Login**
   - Employees (agents) log in to access the **Agent Dashboard**, real-time **Queue Management**, and collaboration tools.
   - Admins have privileged access to administrative controls and system configuration.

## 2. Customer Journey

1. **Knowledge Base & Self-Service**
   - Upon logging in, customers can search the knowledge base or FAQ articles.
   - AI-powered features surface suggested content to quickly resolve frequent queries.

2. **Ticket Creation**
   - If self-service doesn't solve the issue, customers submit tickets from the portal or via email/live chat.
   - Priority levels, custom fields, and metadata are captured to inform routing and expedite resolution.

3. **Ticket Tracking**
   - Customers can view live updates on their requests and add comments or attachments.
   - Friendly status labels and timestamps keep them informed of progress.

4. **Live Chat & Communication**
   - Customers can escalate issues through direct chat with support agents.
   - Automated notifications update them about progress or required actions.

5. **Feedback & Ratings**
   - After resolution, customers can leave feedback that helps improve support quality and system learning.

## 3. Employee Journey

1. **Queue Management**
   - Agents see a real-time queue of tickets with search, sorting, and filtering options.
   - Bulk operations let agents handle repetitive tasks efficiently.

2. **Ticket Interaction & Collaboration**
   - Agents open detailed ticket views to review the conversation history, add internal notes, and update statuses.
   - Rich text editing and macros template responses for consistent, quick communication.

3. **Escalation & Collaboration**
   - If specialized knowledge is required, agents tag additional team members, re-assign the ticket, or leave internal notes for guidance.

4. **Performance Tools**
   - Agents track their personal metrics (e.g., response times, resolution rates) in the dashboard.
   - Analytics and reports highlight areas for improvement or training opportunities.

## 4. Administrative Journey

1. **Team & Role Management**
   - Admins create teams and manage permissions such as different skill sets and role-based access.
   - Coverage schedules ensure round-the-clock support, balancing workloads across time zones.

2. **Routing Intelligence**
   - Rule-based and skills-based routing assigns tickets to the most qualified teams or individuals.
   - Load balancing prevents agent burnout by distributing tickets evenly.

3. **Data & System Configuration**
   - Admins add custom fields, metrics, and tags to tailor the system for specific business needs.
   - Migrations, schema updates, and archival policies are managed here.

4. **Auditing & Oversight**
   - Audit logs track all changes, ensuring transparency and compliance.
   - Admin dashboards display metrics across teams, highlighting performance trends and service level adherence.

## 5. Integration & Automation

1. **APIs & Webhooks**
   - Third-party integrations pull/push ticket data, trigger automations, or enable external reporting.
   - Webhooks notify apps in real-time about ticket events for advanced workflows.

2. **AI Enhancements**
   - Conversation data is analyzed to improve chatbot responses and recommend helpful articles.
   - Potential solutions and proactive suggestions reduce manual workload.

## 6. User Flow Summary

1. **Customer**: Logs in → Searches Knowledge Base → Creates Ticket (if needed) → Monitors Status → Interacts via Portal/Chat → Leaves Feedback.
2. **Agent**: Logs in → Views Queue → Picks Ticket → Resolves/Collaborates → Updates Ticket → Monitors Personal Metrics.
3. **Admin**: Logs in → Manages Teams & Workflows → Configures Data Models & Routing → Monitors System Performance → Reviews Audits & Adjusts Policies.

This end-to-end journey ensures customers quickly find help, agents efficiently resolve issues, and administrators maintain a scalable, high-performing environment.
