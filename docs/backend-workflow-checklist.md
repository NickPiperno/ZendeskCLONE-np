## Phase 5: UI Integration
### Component Architecture
- [x] Define component updates needed
  - [x] Decided on tickets module organization
  - [x] Created thread component structure:
    ```
    src/modules/tickets/
    ├─ components/
    │  ├─ thread/
    │  │  ├─ ThreadView.tsx
    │  │  └─ MessageComposer.tsx
    ```
- [x] Component Implementatio
  - [x] ThreadView.tsx
    - [x] Threaded conversation layout
    - [x] Message grouping
    - [x] AI status indicators
  - [x] MessageComposer.tsx
    - [x] Tactile input experience
    - [x] Real-time feedback
    - [x] Error handling
- [x] Styling Requirements
  - [x] Implement Modern Skeuomorphic theme
    - [x] Subtle shadows and depth
    - [x] Soft gradients and transitions
    - [x] Interactive feedback

### UI Development
- [x] Update existing components
  - [x] Add thread visualization
  - [x] Implement reply interface
  - [x] Add loading states
- [x] Implement styling and interactions
  - [x] Modern Skeuomorphic design
  - [x] Animation effects
- [x] Integrate with backend services
  - [x] React Query integration
  - [x] Real-time updates
  - [x] Error handling

## Phase 6: Data Migration
- [x] ~~Create migration script~~ (N/A - No existing data to migrate)
  - [x] ~~Convert existing notes to threaded format~~
  - [x] ~~Generate thread IDs for existing conversations~~
  - [x] ~~Update timeline events~~
- [x] ~~Validation queries~~ (N/A - No existing data to validate)
  - [x] ~~Verify data integrity~~
  - [x] ~~Check permissions~~
  - [x] ~~Test timeline consistency~~

Note: Phase 6 was skipped as there were no existing tickets in the application that required migration to the new threaded format.

## Phase 7: Testing and Validation
### Backend Testing
- [ ] Unit tests
  - [ ] Thread creation/management
  - [ ] Timeline retrieval
  - [ ] Permission checks
- [ ] Integration tests
  - [ ] Full conversation flow
  - [ ] AI interaction tests
  - [ ] Timeline rendering
- [ ] Performance testing
  - [ ] Query optimization
  - [ ] Index effectiveness
  - [ ] Load testing

### UI Testing
- [ ] Design compliance
- [ ] Animation/transition behavior
- [ ] Theme compatibility
- [ ] Accessibility
- [ ] Responsive design

## Phase 8: Documentation
- [ ] Update API documentation
- [ ] Add thread management guidelines
- [ ] Document AI integration points
- [ ] Update security documentation
- [ ] Document UI component changes
- [ ] Update TypeScript types documentation

## Success Criteria
1. Existing functionality remains intact
